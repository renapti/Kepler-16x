## v1.0.0

### **The Beginning**

v1.0.0 is based on Rena's Edit 2.2, a development version of this pack never seen in the wild!

Removed most unchanged vanilla textures, bringing the hefty 6000+ file count down to under 300. This saves space and time for everyone! (And for putting this on GitHub!)

- Raised pack version from 8 to 9 for compatibility with 1.19
- Updated pack icon with unique icons for every flavor
- Tweaked '~' (Tilde Character) in Bubbles
- Replaced Inventory Hotbar Numbers with new numbers from Bubbles
- Changed Inventory Hotbar Numbers from "1-5, Z-V" to the generic "1-9"
- Renamed to nebula 16x (Renamed later)
