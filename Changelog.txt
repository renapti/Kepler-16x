THIS VERSION IS WIP DO NOT PUBLISH!!!
==========  v1.1 ~ The Overhaul Update!  ==========
This update aims to add many new features and refreshes the current designs!
Here you see the biggest update in reNebula's History!

- Completely overhauled HUD
- Revamped GUI Buttons
- Tweaked Armor & Offhand Slot Inventory Icons
- Did some Tweaks to Bubbles, TODO (Also updated Official Bubbles TTF)
TODO - Did some Tweaks to Renaptish
- Fixed and Improved Carved Pumpkin Overlay
- Added some Custom Colors for Colormatic / OptiFine users! (Loading screen only works on OptiFine)
- Re-done Swords
- Tweaked Main Tools
- More Obvious Custom Enchantment Glint
- Re-done Common Particles
- Added several New Splashes
- EXPERIMENTAL: Added custom Shaders for Item Tooltip / Highlight, and Inventory Text (readability)

This update also discontinues the Renaptish variant. Renaptish is not updated often, so v1.1 is the final version of the Renaptish variant. If you want to use any further updated versions of the language, you will need to use Mint. Sorry!

I was planning to re-do the tools to match the swords as well, however they didn't turn out great.
For now, only the Netherite Tools have minor tweaks.
If you'd like to see the other tools in a future release, let me know!
