- [ ] Bedrock (Not yet planned)

---

## Recommendations

This Resource Pack is compatible with [Appleskin](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin/versions)! Get a handy overlay of your saturation, now with Kepler Compatibility!

I recommend using [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads) / [Colormatic](https://modrinth.com/mod/colormatic/versions) with this pack for the Custom Font Colors, Durability Bar Gradient, and XP Orb Color, however it is by no means required.

There is a [long-unfixed bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-67532) in Minecraft that cuts off the bottom of the Hotbar selector. Luckily, this issue has been fixed with the mod [Raised](https://modrinth.com/mod/raised/versions), which I highly recommend using with this pack.

## ²Installing Bubbles Alt

This resource pack comes with two versions of its custom font, Bubbles. The default version is the definitive version of the font, and the alternate version looks closer to crude handwriting.

The folder for Bubbles Alt is included in every release (if it has been updated in that release). To install it, grab a copy of Kepler 16x and Bubbles Alt (if there is none in the latest release, you can download it from the latest branch, or look for the last release with Bubbles Alt), open the Bubbles Alt folder, and drag everything inside into your Kepler folder. You may be prompted to replace a few files, click `Yes`.

![Replace Files Prompt in Windows 10/11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115433521/203174687-5033d587-a67e-404c-bb97-96ac53bb9ee4.png)

If the files copy successfully, Congratulations — You've now installed Bubbles Alt, just like that! You can drag Kepler 16x into your Minecraft instance's `resourcepacks` folder to use the pack with the alternate font.

*Bubbles Alt inspired by a Discord User "Jell-O"'s Custom Minecraft Font*
